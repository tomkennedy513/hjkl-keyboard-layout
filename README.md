# hjkl-keyboard-layout
experimental keyboard layout that preserves hjkl position in relation to eachother. Inspired by colemak, this layout tries to preserve some familiarity coming from qwerty by keeping the zxcvb area the same, and hjkl stays together (this is mostly for vim navigation). 

From my testing on https://klanext.keyboard-design.com , this layout performs consistently in the top 10 for all the tests I ran, but falls behind against layouts that don't optimize familiarity coming from qwerty.

See [layout.md](layout.md) for the default layout and [layout-alternative.md](layout-alternative.md) for a marginally more efficient version.
